            More than 800 years of exquisite
            sheet metal brass engravings
            and relics can be found here,
            in Pembarthi. Pembarthi is a
            village situated about 80 km
            from Hyderabad. The region

            of various Hindu temples.
            Pembarthi Brassware has
            retained the vital nuances
            of both Hindu and Muslim
            influences over the years,
            allowing it to mix smoothly
            into both cultures. The famous

            Pembarthi Village is known
            across the world for its
            brassware, artefacts, metal
            tools, and everyday goods, as
            well as statues, carvings, and
            castings created from copper
            alloys such as brass and bronze.
            Pembathi Village’s
            Metalworkers, or
            “Vishwakarmas,” have a
            long history of outstanding
            craftsmanship dating back to
            the Kakatiya Kingdom’s majesty
            and glory. This Metal Craft
            attained the peak of perfection
            of highest degree of skill which
            is demonstrated by the master
            craftsmen.
            The rulers of Pembarthi
            patronised the Vishwakaramas
            for building temples, making
            ‘Vigrahas’ - deity idols,
            ‘Vahanas’ – chariots, and other
            creative accessories of temple
            sculpture. The exquisite
            Vigrahas, which are examples of
            moulded crafts, and the ‘Keerthi
            Mukha’, ‘Prabha’ - Pinnacles,
            which adorn many notable
            temples in South India.
            The beauty and glory of the
            Kakatiya dynasty gradually
            gave way to the Nizam’s
            power, resulting in a shift in
            Pembarthi art. As a result,
            during the Nizam period,
            the Vishwakarmas created
            and crafted household and
            decorative objects like as
            Pandans, Nagardans, Itar pots,
            and Sangaridans. The rise of the
            craft led to an increase in the
            number of artisans families in
            Pembarthi who were involved
            in it at this time. The number
            of artisan families involved
            increased to around 600 during
            this time.
            Because of the mastery
            and ability displayed by the
            craftsmen, the craft has
            endured political ups and downs
            as well as natural disasters.
            Following independence,
            the craft had a renaissance,
            resulting in a shift in demand

          <h3> Present Status </h3>

          <p class="text">
            
            The artisans take part in welfare
            and awareness programs for the
            artisans.
            100 families are practicing
            currently, (besides Vishwakarma
            there are other communities
            that practice it as well).
            Online business is done
            via Facebook, WhatsApp,
            promotions via exhibitions.

          <h2> ADAPTION OF THE ARTISANS </h2>

          <p class="text">
            
            During different festivals like
            Muharram, Mr Khalid one of
            the pembarthi artisans gave
            us an insight into how he
            sells products according to
            that particular festival, and
            for the rest of the year, they
            sell trophies, utensils, vases,
            worship idols.
            Presently their main focus is
            home decorative items as there
            is no much demand for brass
            utensils.
            Instead of making devatha
            designs on some decorative
            products, they replaced them
            with other designs such as birds
            and animal designs so that the
            products can be purchased by
            people of different religions and
            communities and can be sold
            globally.
            Normally the head of the family
            use to teach their children
            pembarthi handicraft from the
            age of 14-18 and then by the
            age of 24 they use master that
            skill, whereas now that the
            time has changed the artisans
            provide their children with
            better education facilities for
            betterment of their future.

          <h2> STAGES OF PRODUCTION </h2>
          <h2> PROCESS </h2>
          <h3> Sheet Embossing </h3>
          <div class="text">
            <p> A metal sheet of brass is
              required to emboss the
              design on it.
          Lac (Lakka) is spread on the
            wooden plank that holds
            the metal sheet and more
            delicate design surfaces.
          It is a mixture of Beeswax,
            resins, castor, mustard oil,
            brick and dust.
        Chisel (Kila) is required to
          carve the design on the
          metal sheet.
          Gas torch burner- needed
            to melt the lac and join the
            metal pieces.
          Concentrated Acid (Nitric
            acid, Sulphuric acid etc.) and
            tamarind- used to wash the
            product.
          File and buffer- To smoothen
            the edges and enhance its
            lustre.
          Diluted Gum- to stick the
            design on the metal sheet.</p>
          </div>  
          <br> </br>
          <h3> Sheet Embossing / Flat Ornamentation </h3>

          <p class="text">
            
          In this technique, a Brass or
          copper sheet is cut according
          to the requirement. Later they
          shape and fix it on a wooden
          table with the four sides of the
          sheet covered with Lac (Lucca).
          It effectively sets the sheet on a
          wooden plank or table.
          1. The design is drawn on a
          paper sheet and later pasted
          on the brass sheet. They are
          carved on the sheets using
          fine instruments (chisel and
          hammer).
          2. After carving the basic
          design, the paper sheet is
          removed. Lac is heated, and
          the carved sheet is removed
          from the plank. Further,
          delicate carvings are added
          by hammering the sheet
          with different shapes and
          sizes of chisels. Ash powder
          is used to clean the sheet,
          and detailed embossing is
          added respectively. Some
          parts are designed and
          embossed individually and
          later welded together using
          a gas torch burner.
          3. To provide the shine, acid
          and tamarind are used to
          wash the embossed sheet.
          It is later filed to smoothen
          the edges and buffed to give
          illumination and lustre to the
          surface

          </p>

          <h3> Hollow Sheeting </h3>

          <p class="text">
            
            This process is used to make
            hollow utilitarian or decorative
            items.
            In this process, the sheet
            takes the shape of a hollow
            container according to the
            mould of POP used. A4’*4
            ‘ sheet of brass is taken
            as the raw material. It is
            weighed in kilograms and is
            taken as per the customer
            requirements. The metal
            Sheet is measured as per
            the mould required; An extra
            two inches of the sheet is
            also measured.
            The sheet is beaten with
            a variety of tools and a
            hammer to give it a proper
            shape. It is heated using
            a blow torch and beaten
            until the form is achieved.
            Almost 75% of the work is
            completed in this stage. It
            is then washed in the Conc.
            Acid to clean the surface.
            The next step is to heat Lak
            and pour it into the shaped
            metal. Upon cooling, the
            desired design is made on
            the shaped metal as per the
            artisan’s views.
            The Lak is then heated
            and removed. Once the
            product is ready, it is either
            delivered to the customer
            or showcased in the
            showroom.
